(by nullr00t)

I will be modifying the menu as I can to keep up with what tools can and can't be installed.

Tools Removed : 

11 - Password Attacks
Multiforcer

12 - Reverse Engineering

Distorm (python-distorm3)
JD
OllyDbg
Valgrind
YARA

TODO:
Modify the numbers of the tools so that a number is not skipped or missing (For neatness sake) 

---------------------------------------------07 / 02 / 2017----------------------------------------------------

Number of tools in start of script has been revised to show that 325 tools are now available instead of 331.
Modified numbers assigned to tools as to not confuse the reader by skipping numbers of previously removed tools.

----------------------------------------- 05 / 10 / 2018 -------------------------------------------------------

Multiple changes have been made to reflect the availability of tools that are offered through the kali rolling 
repos as well as making the code of the script more human readable in a text editor. Correction of numbers on
the tools as well as attempts at making it easier to navigate have been done.
